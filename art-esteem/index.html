          <p>ArtEsteem is Attitudinal Healing Connection’s award-winning art and literacy program that develops creative, engaged and successful children and youth through building knowledge and emotional, social, academic and intellectual skills.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1995, ArtEsteem engages students and supports their positive development – body, mind, and heart. Participants discover how to self reflect and dream, as well as focus on their tasks and “follow through” by completing their art projects. Our methods guide students to think practically about the world and their abilities to manifest positive and creative outcomes. Classes also build students’ language and math literacy, aesthetic appreciation, and listening, critical thinking and performance skills. Our students learn – through dialogue, reading, and writing – conceptual understandings of social, historical, and cultural topics to engage and inform their minds, and develop the whole child, in expansive ways.</p>

        <p>ArtEsteem students are propelled to see themselves differently-- internally, personally, as well as in relation to the issues in their communities and of the world, and they are encouraged to view themselves as active change agents. Participants can become more able to self manage, make positive choices, and exercise awareness and kindness with self and others. ArtEsteem invites participants to feel powerful in helpful, beautiful, and productive ways instead of feeling and acting worthless, powerless, or out of control.</p>

      <div class="section-main-content">
        <p>The “Self As Super Hero” Curriculum takes children, youth, and adults through a journey of self exploration, family and cultural research, societal assessment, and development of aesthetic tools for artistic creation. First, a school and/or teacher is identified and then art instructors work hand in hand with school teachers to implement the curriculum. They take the students through a journey, using the ArtEsteem Super Hero to re-define the self that embodies super powers that help create a more loving and peaceful world. Once children collaboratively develop their own super heroes, they use these stories to conceptually design a mural as part of the Oakland Super Heroes Mural Project. The Self As Super Hero Curriculum can be found in the <span class="bold">&#34;Self As Super Hero Book: Handbook for Creating the Life Size Self Portrait&#34;</span> which is available for <a href="http://ahc-oakland.org/store/" target="_blank">purchase here</a>.</p>

              <h2>Ricoya Cathey, KIPP Bridge College Preparatory</h2>
              <p>The artwork that I did is about a 13 year old girl who tries to stop all the evil that happens. One type of evil she tries to stop is racism. Whenever she sees or feels that someone is being racist she comes and touches them and sooner or later they feel like they've been treated racially too. They will feel what they make others feel. I divided my painting into a light side and a dark side represented by the sun and moon. The dark side represents the bad; the light side represents the good. This shows the way we should and shouldn't act.</p>

              <h2>Devita Diaz, Westlake Middle School</h2>
              <p>My painting is about two friends who had a fight over a boy. To me it represents stupidity because the two friends have been friends since they were born. There is the saying that "There are plenty of fish in the sea," but in the moment little things seem like the end of the world. It takes maturity and strength to realize that there are bigger problems in the world than fighting over a boy. I painted the two friends connected to represent their long connection emotionally since childhood. The figures look sad because of the small hiccup in their friendship. I also added colors I consider happy and bright to show that all things come to pass, even sadness. Friendships are essential. I hope that people who see my painting remember to be patient and kind to their friends.</p>

        <p class="rec-quote">"The ArtEsteem Program helped me discover the beautiful things I wanted to create within myself. It was another life for me. To me art has its own gravity, its own force and despite it creates another life, it somehow represents the life of the world and especially the life of the mind. Without the program and my own creativity for art I would have no reason to live."</p>

        <p class="rec-quote">"I have such great respect and admiration for the way that ArtEsteem introduces art to students.  The instructors are exceptional at their crafts and are able to reach those students that are often hard to reach.  The quiet layers of expertise which combine art with the teachings of non-violent practice through restorative justice and conflict resolution, is an art form in itself."</p>

            artist="Jesus Maldonado, 8th grade – KIPP Bridge College Preparatory" 
            artwork-info="This is my first time exhibiting art. But I draw all the time. Sometimes I make drawings about my race, like drawings of low-riders because they represent me. My painting, as you can see, is about “good is in evil as evil is in good”. Each thing has its opposite. Like sun and moon, day and night, sound and silence. Even we have an opposite, a dark side and a light side. We are half dark and half light. We are not equal until we have light and dark and dark and light. This character is a Superhero and a villain. His name is Zero because the good and evil in him cancel each other out. He follows people’s actions – if they do good, he does good. If they do bad, he does bad. People have to realize that their decisions are affecting each other.">

          artwork-info="In the left-hand corner of the painting, I drew the weapons that Red and Blue Butterfly uses. They are the Chain of Love, the Wand of Craziness, the Happiness Mirror, the Love Mirror and the Hug of Love. The Chain of Love is Level 1, and it is used to destroy hate and put love in your heart. The Wand of Craziness is Level 2, and it causes chaos with love. The Happiness Mirror is Level 1 ½, and it is used to destroy anger and put happiness in your heart. The Love Mirror is Level 3, and it is used to reflect love and annihilate hate. The Hug of Love is Level 2 ½, and it is used to destroy hate put love in your heart. The color of the Chain of Love, the Hug of Love, and the Love Mirror is orange. The color of the Happiness Mirror and the Wand of Craziness is yellow. On the right corner, I drew Red and Blue Butterfly flying over buildings. In the bottom left hand corner, I drew Maki John and Red and Blue Butterfly holding hands, talking to each other. My artist statement is “the wolf in me isn’t gone, it is waiting to be released.”

This image shows my physical appearance, like how I look, how I dress, the way I put my hair, and also my race.  But this is only part of me… The other represents a part of me that no one but a few people have seen.  That’s why this side is shaded in.  That represents the fear inside of me, the anger, my weakness, some of my dreams and my secrets.

The yellow represents all philosophies.  The large eye represents the people. To me the painting is how contemporary society invents different philosophies and changes older ones.

title="Broken Orbit "
artist="Sara Gonzalez, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School" 
artwork-info="My painting is about focusing on the whole of life rather than the fragments. I painted Earth to represent wholeness. The background of my painting is made up of meteors, stars, and the sun, which represent fragments or distractions. I feel that as a community we often focus on the fragments rather than the whole. In the painting, the Earth is cracked and damaged by all the chaos occurring outside of it. I hope that we can take better care of our Earth and each other, but in order to do so we have to remember we are all connected. We are one.">

artwork-info="My character Shuri is one of the most powerful super human beings.  He began his superhero saga at age 5.  Shuri was born in Kyoto, Japan in 1989.  When he grew up in Kyoto, he was a Judo teacher before he had any super human powers.Shuri’s powers are shape shifting, earth, water, fire, air, and thunder.  He uses them to help the world.  The world needs Shuri because of his superhuman strength and his ability to use the four major elements.  He helps fight global warming by controlling the heat waves.  When his planet, Zuri, was almost destroyed by the Big Bang, he was able to reverse the destruction to save the planet.">

title="No Justice, No Education "
artist="Arwa Omar,  11th grade - McClymonds High School" 
artwork-info="I decided to do my artwork based on past experiences working with organizations that deal with urban youth working towards quality teaching.  I feel that OUSD schools receive fewer resources for students to be successful in high school, compared to private high schools.  Too often, we are set up to fail by lacking in teachers and school supplies, such as books.  Sometimes we are put into a class that is set to fail us.  Most of this is happening in urban areas with people of color, like Oakland.  The experiences I have had, motivated me to express my thoughts visually in art. 
I feel that we live under a system based on the color of our skin.
Why is education determined by politics?
Why is it that schools are funded based on the area and the students?
Educational Justice">

title="A Piece of Me "
artist="Takiyanna Hamilton, 11th Grade – Ralph Bunche High School" 
artwork-info="This is a poster expressing my life with a word.  It’s a picture or drawing if you will, of a woman who’s gone through hard trials.  It’s painted with various colors, bright and bold.  The woman expresses the life she’s gone through.  Her scarred skin is a story of abuse.  Her sad eyes tell a tale of sorrow.  The expression her face is her story, her life.">

<a href="img/new/Artwork13.jpg"
title="Tragic love "
artist="David Silas Hokes Jr., 9th Grade - McClymonds High School" 
artwork-info="The reason I created this piece is because of my love for people, and my past relationships.  When people break up, they feel hurt and can’t concentrate on what they are doing.  That is what was happening to me, so I had t do something so that I could stop feeling hurt by the break-up.
This piece is not just for me.  It is for everyone who has broken up with someone.  Everyone has something in common because everyone has loved something.  This shows five things; one – love something, two – love is strong, three – love could be good, four – love could be bad, and five – love can feel like heaven but hurt like hell.">

artist="Willani Powell, 3rd Grade – Santa Fe Elementary" 
artwork-info="The problem in my community is that people keep littering here.  Another problem is that people keep shooting each other.  We need to stop!  My power is to clean the air and stop crime.  I push clean air out of my eye and I tell the criminals to stop the crime to help fix the problem.">

title="Me So Scared "
artist="Malcolm Thompson, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School" 
artwork-info="My painting is about fear. My grandfather has been getting sick a lot lately which has been scary at times. In my head I've been howling about how much I worry about him. I thought a howler monkey would be a good representation of how I feel. I decided to paint the monkey face large and threatening. When I care about somebody who is not feeling well it is like having someone looming over me, like someone hanging over my shoulder, reminding me that someone close to me is ill. I feel that the painting was a success, it has that feeling I wanted to describe. Since the monkey face is so large and bright, it is hard to evade the monkey's screaming face.">

          <p>ArtEsteem is Attitudinal Healing Connection’s award-winning art and literacy program that develops creative, engaged and successful children and youth through building knowledge and emotional, social, academic and intellectual skills.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1995, ArtEsteem engages students and supports their positive development – body, mind, and heart. Participants discover how to self reflect and dream, as well as focus on their tasks and “follow through” by completing their art projects. Our methods guide students to think practically about the world and their abilities to manifest positive and creative outcomes. Classes also build students’ language and math literacy, aesthetic appreciation, and listening, critical thinking and performance skills. Our students learn – through dialogue, reading, and writing – conceptual understandings of social, historical, and cultural topics to engage and inform their minds, and develop the whole child, in expansive ways.</p>

        <p>ArtEsteem students are propelled to see themselves differently-- internally, personally, as well as in relation to the issues in their communities and of the world, and they are encouraged to view themselves as active change agents. Participants can become more able to self manage, make positive choices, and exercise awareness and kindness with self and others. ArtEsteem invites participants to feel powerful in helpful, beautiful, and productive ways instead of feeling and acting worthless, powerless, or out of control.</p>

        <p>The “Self As Super Hero” Curriculum takes children, youth, and adults through a journey of self exploration, family and cultural research, societal assessment, and development of aesthetic tools for artistic creation. First, a school and/or teacher is identified and then art instructors work hand in hand with school teachers to implement the curriculum. They take the students through a journey, using the ArtEsteem Super Hero to re-define the self that embodies super powers that help create a more loving and peaceful world. Once children collaboratively develop their own super heroes, they use these stories to conceptually design a mural as part of the Oakland Super Heroes Mural Project. The Self As Super Hero Curriculum can be found in the <span class="bold">&#34;Self As Super Hero Book: Handbook for Creating the Life Size Self Portrait&#34;</span> which is available for <a href="http://ahc-oakland.org/store/" target="_blank">purchase here</a>.</p>

              <p>The artwork that I did is about a 13 year old girl who tries to stop all the evil that happens. One type of evil she tries to stop is racism. Whenever she sees or feels that someone is being racist she comes and touches them and sooner or later they feel like they've been treated racially too. They will feel what they make others feel. I divided my painting into a light side and a dark side represented by the sun and moon. The dark side represents the bad; the light side represents the good. This shows the way we should and shouldn't act.</p>

              <h2>Westlake Middle School, 7th Grade</h2>
              <p>Paris is a 103 year-old Unicornian who takes the form of a 17 year-old human girl, from a far-away planet called Unicornia. She decides to move to Earth because of the danger and poverty that exists on her home planet. She has a magic tattoo made from “secret and rare Unicornian ink” and brings with her a musical instrument, called the “saxalin, a saxophone mixed with a violin”, created from a meteor and intertwined with her soul. She finds herself in Oakland where she is adopted as a baby by loving parents. As a toddler she realizes that Oakland is in no better condition than Unicornia and begins to plan how to love and help her community. Once older, “Paris stops aging” and with her “magic powers matured,” she decides to put her plan into action. At the wave of her arm with the magic tattoo, she commands all the animals in the Bay Area to help clean polluted water and harmful radiation in the Oakland community. (The magic Unicornian ink enables the animals to ingest the pollution without injury, “making it disappear”). Paris also recognized other problems around her such as drug abuse, and so played her magic saxalin, which would remove all destructive and addictive thoughts from the listener’s mind.</p>

            artist="Arwa Omar, 11th grade - McClymonds High School" 
            artwork-info="I decided to do my artwork based on past experiences working with organizations that deal with urban youth working towards quality teaching.  I feel that OUSD schools receive fewer resources for students to be successful in high school, compared to private high schools.  Too often, we are set up to fail by lacking in teachers and school supplies, such as books.  Sometimes we are put into a class that is set to fail us.  Most of this is happening in urban areas with people of color, like Oakland.  The experiences I have had, motivated me to express my thoughts visually in art. 
I feel that we live under a system based on the color of our skin.
Why is education determined by politics?
Why is it that schools are funded based on the area and the students?
Educational Justice.">

          artwork-info="This is a poster expressing my life with a word.  It’s a picture or drawing if you will, of a woman who’s gone through hard trials.  It’s painted with various colors, bright and bold.  The woman expresses the life she’s gone through.  Her scarred skin is a story of abuse.  Her sad eyes tell a tale of sorrow.  The expression her face is her story, her life.">

        artist="David Silas Hokes Jr., 9th Grade - McClymonds High School"
        artwork-info="The reason I created this piece is because of my love for people, and my past relationships.  When people break up, they feel hurt and can’t concentrate on what they are doing.  That is what was happening to me, so I had to do something so that I could stop feeling hurt by the break-up.
This piece is not just for me.  It is for everyone who has broken up with someone.  Everyone has something in common because everyone has loved something.  This shows five things; one – love something, two – love is strong, three – love could be good, four – love could be bad, and five – love can feel like heaven but hurt like hell.">

This image shows my physical appearance, like how I look, how I dress, the way I put my hair, and also my race.  But this is only part of me… The other represents a part of me that no one but a few people have seen.  That’s why this side is shaded in.  That represents the fear inside of me, the anger, my weakness, some of my dreams and my secrets.">

title="Mick Eye "
artist="Mikhi Woodley, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School"
artwork-info="I created a painting about different philosophies. I used a lot of green in my painting. To me, green represents change or rebirth. People keep switching their philosophies. The yellow represents all philosophies.  The large eye represents the people. To me the painting is how contemporary society invents different philosophies and changes older ones.

title="Broken Orbit "
artist="Sara Gonzalez, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School"
artwork-info="My painting is about focusing on the whole of life rather than the fragments. I painted Earth to represent wholeness. The background of my painting is made up of meteors, stars, and the sun, which represent fragments or distractions. I feel that as a community we often focus on the fragments rather than the whole. In the painting, the Earth is cracked and damaged by all the chaos occurring outside of it. I hope that we can take better care of our Earth and each other, but in order to do so we have to remember we are all connected. We are one.">

title="Me So Scared "
artist="Malcolm Thompson, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School"
artwork-info="My painting is about fear. My grandfather has been getting sick a lot lately which has been scary at times. In my head I've been howling about how much I worry about him. I thought a howler monkey would be a good representation of how I feel. I decided to paint the monkey face large and threatening. When I care about somebody who is not feeling well it is like having someone looming over me, like someone hanging over my shoulder, reminding me that someone close to me is ill. I feel that the painting was a success because it has that feeling I wanted to describe. Since the monkey face is so large and bright, it is hard to evade the monkey's screaming face.">

<a href="img/new/Artwork11.jpg"
title="U and I, No More "
artist="Devita Diaz, 6th Grade – Westlake Middle School"
artwork-info="My painting is about two friends who had a fight over a boy. To me it represents stupidity because the two friends have been friends since they were born. There is the saying that &#34;There are plenty of fish in the sea,&#34; but in the moment little things seem like the end of the world. It takes maturity and strength to realize that there are bigger problems in the world than fighting over a boy. I painted the two friends connected to represent their long connection emotionally since childhood. The figures look sad because of the small hiccup in their friendship. I also added colors I consider happy and bright to show that all things come to pass, even sadness. Friendships are essential. I hope that people who see my painting remember to be patient and kind to their friends.">

title="Zero "
artist="Jesus Maldonado, 8th grade – KIPP Bridge College Preparatory"
artwork-info="This is my first time exhibiting art. But I draw all the time. Sometimes I make drawings about my race, like drawings of low-riders because they represent me. My painting, as you can see, is about “good is in evil as evil is in good”. Each thing has its opposite. Like sun and moon, day and night, sound and silence. Even we have an opposite, a dark side and a light side. We are half dark and half light. We are not equal until we have light and dark and dark and light. This character is a Superhero and a villain. His name is Zero because the good and evil in him cancel each other out. He follows people’s actions – if they do good, he does good. If they do bad, he does bad. People have to realize that their decisions are affecting each other.">

title="Red and Blue Butterfly "
artist="Mikayla Johnson, 8th Grade – KIPP Bridge College Preparatory"
artwork-info="In the left-hand corner of the painting, I drew the weapons that Red and Blue Butterfly uses. They are the Chain of Love, the Wand of Craziness, the Happiness Mirror, the Love Mirror and the Hug of Love. The Chain of Love is Level 1, and it is used to destroy hate and put love in your heart. The Wand of Craziness is Level 2, and it causes chaos with love. The Happiness Mirror is Level 1 ½, and it is used to destroy anger and put happiness in your heart. The Love Mirror is Level 3, and it is used to reflect love and annihilate hate. The Hug of Love is Level 2 ½, and it is used to destroy hate put love in your heart. The color of the Chain of Love, the Hug of Love, and the Love Mirror is orange. The color of the Happiness Mirror and the Wand of Craziness is yellow. On the right corner, I drew Red and Blue Butterfly flying over buildings. In the bottom left hand corner, I drew Maki John and Red and Blue Butterfly holding hands, talking to each other. My artist statement is &#34;the wolf in me isn’t gone, it is waiting to be released.&#34;">

Shuri’s powers are shape shifting, earth, water, fire, air, and thunder.  He uses them to help the world.  The world needs Shuri because of his superhuman strength and his ability to use the four major elements.  He helps fight global warming by controlling the heat waves.

title="Tahirah who Walks with the Moon"
artist="Amana Harris, Family Art Night"
artwork-info="<img style=&#34;height:320px; margin:0 auto; display:block;&#34; src=&#34;img/new/Artwork17.jpg&#34; />Tahirah walks with the moon as the moon travels around the earth at 66,000,0000 miles per hour. The moon is her husband, and Tahirah walks on the earth where the moon is full. Her presence is powerful, and the moon shines ever so brightly when in her midst. Tahirah’s first source of power is her head wrap. Her wrap is endless and can span any length necessary. Her wrap provides powers for her two daughters named Mizan and Johari. Mizan and Johari walk the earth and help her provide healing in places she can’t reach. Tahirah’s powers focus mainly on humans. A touch of her wrap to the girls and the power to soften hearts and attitudes, heal wounds, broken hearts and pain from acts of violence is manifested in their hair.
Tahirah walks with her drum. Her drum is her second source of power, and when beaten generates a rhythmic sound that heals those chosen to hear it. The drum's healing powers are many, focusing mainly on curing drug addictions, mental illness, depression, and tendencies towards hate and violence. The drum deals with mourning, hurt, and pain of the heart and mind. The drum understands this as the root cause of sickness, violence, and hate. The drum, which beats a rhythmic beat, opens up the hearts of those that hears its sound and fills them with love. The sound of love is what heals, softens and brings joy. Her drum is carried by her magical skirt. Her skirt is her third source of power. Her skirt gives her the speed to walk with the moon and will carry any burden of hers. Her skirt can also feed the hungry with good, wholesome food and has the ability to transform junk food into healthy food.">

title="Mural Man"
artist="Jason, Maxwell Park Elementary"
artwork-info="<img style=&#34;height:320px; margin:0 auto; display:block;&#34; src=&#34;img/new/Artwork18.png&#34; />A young man by the name of Pablo Carlo was walking down Fruitvale Ave on a cold and stormy night back in 1983.  He knew it was going to be a special night. He had in mind the biggest most awesome mural in mind.  He had spent weeks working on it in English class.  He even had the best place to put it up; the wall next to the NPR radio tower at the end of Fruitvale Ave.  He knew there was a hole in the fence and he could get in and out very quickly.  Pablo got to work right away.  He felt he had no time to lose. Colors flew fast and furious.  Blues of all kinds; sky blue, ocean blue, bird egg blue, hung in clouds wrapping themselves around poles and walls.  Reds, purples, yellows going up on to the wall right and left.  Pablo was going through spray cans as quickly as the aerosol could escape.  He was determined to put some beauty back into his hood. Pablo worked like this all through the night.  Non-stop. However, in his excitement he had forgotten to set the cans down quietly and was making quite the racket every time he threw out a can. The Man, who had to spend his nights chasing graffiti artists off the docks, had over the year’s developed an extreme hatred for all art.  Upon hearing the noise, he knew this was his chance to get one of those punks that he often chased but never caught. Pablo was just about done putting on the last layer of purple in a field of electric component flowers he had just painted when he heard the man say, “I got you now punk.” Pablo had no to time to react.  He was going to finish no matter what.  So he just kept on painting. But the storm had arrived and lightening struck.
KKKKKKKKHHHHHHHHHZZZZZZZZAAAAAAPPPPP!
Every thing went black! In the darkness Pablo started to hear the sounds of National Public Radio.  Sounds he had never heard before, stories of hope and fear from all corners of the globe.  For the first time Pablo thought about the world outside his hood.  
As the light started to come back to Pablo, he realized he was in a room of bright white light.  At first he thought, “Am I dead?”  But soon the sound of the nurse made it clear where he was. He was missing his lower legs and in their place he had paintbrushes. Now, many people would have freaked out at that point but not Pablo.  Instead he knew what his destiny would be.  From that day on Pablo became Mural Man.  
Mural Man, a hero for social justice!  Mural Man: able to paint a side of a liquor store with a social message with a single stroke of his brush.  Mural Man: able to turn an empty lot into a community park over night, spaces that would bring together neighborhoods. With his powers he could now beautify whole neighborhoods.  With his NPR powers he could not only make the worlds beautiful but deliver important social messages in his art, bring communities together, get parent involvement at local schools, promote health and environmental issues, and stop street violence.">

<a href="img/new/Artwork19.jpg"
title="Noor Al-Kalam, Noor of Words"
artist="Sakeena Ahsan, ROOTS Academy"
artwork-info="<img style=&#34;height:320px; margin:0 auto; display:block;&#34; src=&#34;img/new/Artwork19.png&#34; /> Noor Hasan began to notice the devastating effects of miscommunication in her own household at a very young age, when her parents began using backhanded ways of conveying their anger towards each other, including the backs of their hands, their credit cards, and their silence.  She soon became aware of miscommunication causing all types and degrees of injustice, not just in her house, but in her neighborhood, nation, and all over the world.  People who were well-intentioned, who cared about each other, who had respectable goals, weren’t respecting each other and were blocking out each other’s words.  Many efforts at communication led to exactly the opposite result.  Noor knew how heavy the oppression from miscommunication could weigh.  She had carried hers since she was a child.
In spite of the examples she was raised with, or perhaps because of them, Noor was always acutely sensitive to the meaning and intention behind people’s words.  She intuited the truth behind many of her parents’ harsh words and actions, leading her to understand that they both had the same desires and cared deeply about each other, but were just too prideful, hurt, and guarded to hear each other fully.  Through humility, patience, compassion, and the deep conviction that people are good, Noor trained herself to listen to and discern the true intentions behind all communications.  People need to be heard, and to hear each other, but few actually know how to do either.  Noor taught herself to do both.
Because of her strong commitment and ready acceptance of her responsibility to use her knowledge to benefit others, Noor was bestowed with powerful gifts by the Angel Gabriel.  Noor Hasan became Noor Al-Kalam, Noor of Words.  Gabriel brought her seven gifts.  The first was Light, her namesake.  Noor’s eyes became strengthened with light, to illuminate any good intentions and chase away pride.  The second gift was Language.  Noor is able to understand, translate, and communicate with any of the tongues of our world—not just English, Arabic, and the like, but the language of pain, of fear, and of anger.  The third gift was Connection.  When Noor joins hands with two people, they can truly connect and reach the root of their intentions.  The fourth gift was Freedom.  Noor can lay out her cape and anyone who sits upon it can communicate with each other, without any preconceived notions, prejudice, or past burdens.  They can be freed of their previous baggage together.  The fifth gift was Perspective.  If anyone wears Noor’s golden sandals, they will be able to take on other people’s perspectives.  If anyone wears Noor’s golden headphones, they will be able to truly hear others’ points of view.  The sixth gift was Grace.  When Noor smiles her Smile of Grace over people, they are able to communicate with dignity and humility towards one another.  The seventh and final gift was Knowledge.  Noor’s Heart of the Matter Dictionary can give the true definition of anyone’s words, unveiling what they really want people to hear.
With her powers, and superpowers, of communication, Noor has helped people hear each other all over the world, including feuding couples, rival gang members, dissatisfied business partners, warring nations, and brothers who hadn’t spoken to each other for eighteen years.  She travels around the world, re-instilling in people the human capacity to understand one another, not just in happiness but in pain as well.">
